### Planning.

I dedicate some time to creating a low-fidelity wireframe with figma during the design process to guide me when building the app.

### Tech stack:

We decided on the following technologies to create our app:

- Next.js
- Typescript
- Netlify

I opted to use Typescript as a language because can lead to a more robust codebase with fewer errors, and Next.js because it simplified building full-stack applications using React. Netlify is a great web development platform that I am familiar with and I am comfortable working with it.

### Workflow.

Workflow.

I took a CD/CI approach from the start of the task. After creating the backlog of the task I deployed the project in Netlify after every main step was achieved. It is an effective way to prevent errors in production and detect them when they are still easy to fix.
